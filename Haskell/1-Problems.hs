-- Problem 1
-- Find the last element of a list.
primeNumbers = [3, 5, 7, 11]
lastPrime = last primeNumbers

-- Problem 2
-- Find the last but one element of a list.

-- Problem 3
-- Find the K'th element of a list.
-- The first element in the list is number 1.

-- Problem 4

-- Problem 5
-- Reverse a list.

-- Problem 6
-- Find out whether a list is a palindrome.
-- A palindrome can be read forward or backward; e.g. (x a m a x).

-- Problem 7
-- Flatten a nested list structure.

-- Transform a list, possibly holding lists as elements into a `flat'
-- list by replacing each list with its elements (recursively).

-- Problem 8
-- Eliminate consecutive duplicates of list elements.
-- If a list contains repeated elements they should be replaced
-- with a single copy of the element. The order of the elements
-- should not be changed.

-- Problem 9
-- Pack consecutive duplicates of list elements into sublists.
-- If a list contains repeated elements they should be placed
-- in separate sublists.
